# Python template for CS3 

### ðŸ“– [PythonDocs Course Website](https://coderina.dev/pythondocs/)

This repository provides a simple **template** with `Python` starter code.

> ðŸš¨ _DO NOT modify the following files:_ `.devcontainer`, `.vscode`

### Codespaces Instructions
1. Click the green `<> Code` button in the top right area above the files.
2. Select the `Codespaces` tab and click `Open Codespace on main `.
3. Wait for the Codespace to setup â€“ it will take some time because extensions are being loaded in automatically.
4. After the extensions load, you can open `main.py` from the File Explorer and now you're ready to code!
